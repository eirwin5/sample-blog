            <h2>Thoughts Before My Upcoming International Experience</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Ellie. I'm a student at the University of Michigan gearing up for an international experience in
                France this winter semester. I've had the pleasure of traveling to France once before when I was around
                12 years old, so I know vaguely what to expect, but I look forward to the opportunity to explore France
                and its surrounding countries with a new outlook. In this blog post, I will share a mix of my emotions
                and thoughts as I gear up for my trip.
            </p>

            <h3>The Thrill of Exploration</h3>
            <p>As for any travel experience, the thrill of exploring new sights is always the most exciting part for me.
                I'm looking forward to exploring and learning about European countries nearby. I'm excited to get
                outside of my comfort zone and focus on exploration.

            <h3>Learning the Local Language and Embracing the Culture</h3>
            <p>I've been studying French language and culture since 7th grade, but I recognize that studying French in
                an American classroom does not begin to compare to immersing yourself into the culture. As I gear up for
                my study abroad experience, I acknowledge my cultural differences, and prepare to be mindful and focus
                on learning and growth. I know my French language skills can always improve.

            <h3>Overcoming Pre-Travel Jitters and Embracing Spontaneity</h3>
            <p>Traveling almost never goes completely according to plan. With this in mind, I embrace any and all
                uncertainty I may encounter on my adventure.
