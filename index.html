            <h2>The Thrill of Exploration</h2>
            <p>As for any travel experience, the thrill of exploring new sights is always the most exciting part for me.
                I'm look forward to explore and learn about European countries nearby. I'm excited to get outside of my
                comfort zone and focus on exploration.</p>

            <h2>Learning the Local Language and Embracing the Culture</h2>
            <p>I've been studying French language and culture since 7th grade, but I recognize that studying French in
                an American classroom does not begin to compare to emerssing yourself into the culutre. As I gear up for
                my study abroad experience, I acknowledge my cultural difference, and prepare to be mindful and focus on
                learning and growth. I know my French language skills can always improve</p>

            <h2>Overcoming Pre-Travel Jitters and Embracing Spontaneity</h2>
            <p>Travelling almost never goes completely according to plan. With this in mind, I have a positive outlook
                on travel, and embrace any and all uncertainty I may encounter on my adventure.</p>
